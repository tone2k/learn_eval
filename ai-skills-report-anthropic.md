# AI Skills Development Report - Deep Search Application

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of skills developed through building an AI-powered deep search application over a 5-day intensive development sprint. The project demonstrates advanced competencies in AI engineering, LLM orchestration, production system design, and modern web development practices directly relevant to an Applied AI role at Anthropic.

## Project Overview

**Application**: AI-powered conversational search system with advanced web scraping, content extraction, and intelligent query processing

**Development Timeline**: July 14-18, 2025 (5-day sprint, 36 commits)

**Core Achievement**: Built a production-ready AI system that combines Google Gemini models with sophisticated agent architecture, implementing patterns that would directly apply to Claude-based systems.

## Key Technical Skills Demonstrated

### 1. Advanced LLM Engineering & Orchestration

#### Multi-Model Strategy & Optimization
- **Implemented specialized model selection** for different tasks:
  - `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`: Primary conversational model for deep reasoning
  - `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`: Fast model for factuality evaluation and lightweight tasks
  - `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`: Optimized for high-volume URL summarization
  - `gemini-2.0-flash-001`: Content safety guardrails with low latency

**Key Implementation**: `src/models.ts`
```typescript
export const defaultModel = geminiPro;
export const factualityModel = google("gemini-1.5-flash-latest");
export const summarizerModel = google("gemini-2.0-flash-lite");
export const guardrailModel = google("gemini-2.0-flash-001");
```

This demonstrates understanding of:
- Model capability/cost tradeoffs
- Task-specific model selection
- Performance optimization strategies

#### Structured Output Generation with Zod Schemas
- **Built robust structured generation patterns** using Zod schemas for deterministic outputs
- **Avoided union types** to improve LLM reliability (noted in `deep-search.ts:17`)
- **Created complex decision trees** for agent behavior

**Example**: Agent action schema
```typescript
const actionSchema = z.object({
  type: z.enum(["continue", "answer"]),
  reasoning: z.string().describe("The reason you chose this step"),
  query: z.string().optional(),
  feedback: z.string().optional()
});
```

### 2. Production AI System Architecture

#### Agent Loop Implementation
- **Designed and implemented a sophisticated agent loop** (`run-agent-loop.ts`) with:
  - Iterative refinement capabilities
  - Context-aware decision making
  - Automatic query rewriting
  - Multi-step reasoning chains

**Key Pattern**: The agent autonomously decides when to:
- Continue searching for more information
- Ask clarifying questions
- Provide final answers
- Apply safety guardrails

#### Stream-First Architecture
- **Implemented real-time streaming responses** using Vercel AI SDK
- **Added text stream smoothing** for better UX
- **Handled backpressure and error states** in streaming contexts

### 3. Advanced Observability & Monitoring

#### Dual Telemetry Architecture
Successfully implemented a sophisticated observability system combining:

1. **OpenTelemetry Auto-instrumentation** via Vercel OTEL
2. **Direct Langfuse Integration** for LLM-specific analytics

**Implementation Highlights**:
- Environment-aware telemetry (dev/prod separation)
- Zero-friction future observability (all AI calls automatically tracked)
- Session-centric analytics using chatId as sessionId
- Comprehensive trace correlation between systems

```typescript
// Auto-instrumentation
registerOTel({
  serviceName: "langfuse-vercel-ai-nextjs-example",
  traceExporter: new LangfuseExporter({ environment: env.NODE_ENV })
});

// Enhanced telemetry with metadata
experimental_telemetry: {
  isEnabled: true,
  functionId: "searchWeb-reasoning",
  metadata: { langfuseTraceId, sessionId: chatId }
}
```

### 4. Content Processing & Web Intelligence

#### Advanced Web Scraping System
Built a production-grade web scraper with:
- **Robots.txt compliance checking**
- **Intelligent content extraction** using Cheerio
- **HTML-to-Markdown conversion** preserving structure
- **Redis caching with 6-hour TTL**
- **Bulk operation support** with error handling
- **Exponential backoff retry logic**

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
const extractArticleText = (html: string): string => {
  const articleSelectors = [
    "article", '[role="main"]', ".post-content", 
    ".article-content", "main", ".content"
  ];
  // Intelligent content extraction logic
};
```

#### Search Result Processing Pipeline
- **Parallel URL summarization** for efficiency
- **Context-aware summarization** considering conversation history
- **Metadata preservation** (dates, snippets, titles)
- **Source attribution** with favicon support

### 5. Safety & Reliability Engineering

#### Content Safety Guardrails
Implemented comprehensive safety system:
- **Conversational context analysis** for safety decisions
- **Pattern detection** for harmful request escalation
- **Fast classification** using specialized model
- **Detailed refusal reasoning** for transparency

#### Evaluation Framework
Built rigorous testing infrastructure using Evalite:
- **Factuality scoring** comparing against ground truth
- **Answer relevancy evaluation** using LLM-as-judge pattern
- **Regression testing** across development/CI/production datasets
- **Deterministic evaluation** capabilities

### 6. Production Infrastructure Skills

#### Database Design & Optimization
- **Normalized schema design** using Drizzle ORM
- **Efficient indexing strategies** for chat and message queries
- **JSON storage patterns** for flexible message content
- **Relationship modeling** with proper foreign keys

#### Caching & Performance
- **Generic Redis caching wrapper** for any async function
- **Intelligent cache key generation** with JSON serialization
- **6-hour TTL strategy** balancing freshness and performance

```typescript
export const cacheWithRedis = <TFunc extends (...args: any[]) => Promise<any>>(
  keyPrefix: string,
  fn: TFunc
): TFunc => {
  // Generic caching implementation
};
```

#### Rate Limiting Implementation
- **Global rate limiter** with configurable windows
